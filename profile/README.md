## About ENIGMA

The ENIGMA Consortium is an international effort by leaders worldwide. The Consortium brings together researchers in imaging genomics, neurology and psychiatry, to understand brain structure and function, based on MRI, DTI, fMRI, genetic data and many patient populations.

The ENIGMA Consortium has several goals:
- to create a network of like-minded individuals, interested in pushing forward the field of imaging genetics
- to ensure promising findings are replicated via member collaborations, in order to satisfy the mandates of most journals
- to share ideas, algorithms, data, and information on promising findings or methods
- to facilitate training, including workshops and conferences on key methods and emerging directions in imaging genetics.


Image processing protocols and genetic analysis protocols for various ENIGMA projects are listed below.
